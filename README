NAME
    Apache::AuthenSMB - mod_perl NT Authentication module

SYNOPSIS
        <Directory /foo/bar>
        # This is the standard authentication stuff
        AuthName "Foo Bar Authentication"
        AuthType Basic

        # Variables you need to set, you must set at least
        # the myPDC variable, the DOMAIN defaults to WORKGROUP      
        PerlSetVar myPDC workgroup-pdc
        PerlSetVar myBDC workgroup-bdc
        PerlSetVar myDOMAIN WORKGROUP

        PerlAuthenHandler Apache::AuthenSmb

        # Standard require stuff, only user and 
        # valid-user work currently
        require valid-user
        </Directory>

        These directives can be used in a .htaccess file as well.

DESCRIPTION
    This perl module is designed to work with mod_perl and the Smb
    module by Patrick Michael Kane (http://www.fatal.org/~modus/).
    You need to set your PDC, BDC, and NT domain name for the script
    to function properly. You MUST set a PDC, if no BDC is set it
    defaults to the PDC, if no DOMAIN is set it defaults to
    WORKGROUP.

    I welcome any feedback on this module. As the Smb module grows I
    plan to expand some of the functionality (ie groups) to this
    script.
